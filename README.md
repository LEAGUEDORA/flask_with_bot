# flask_with_bot
This is a webpage and bot designed with Python Flask


We desgined this page and integrated a bot that helps you to navigate to whatever the page you want just by pressing a single button.

This bot takes input and gives a link that connect to the required page.

We designed this webpage in such a way that it can be used both Auto and Manual mode

Some of the pictures of the bot are given below.

This bot can help in different ways:
  1. Report a player
  2. Help player to contact us
  3. Know about us
  4. Watch a player profile

Disclaimer: Since heroku is not supporting "spacy" external shortcut links, we have restored the previous version. *Please take this as our respectful concern.* We tried even building dependencies and wheels on our own. Even then we couldn't make it. On our personal Systems the code is running perfectly fine. We are posting two YouTube links one with Chatterbot and the other with Local Host. :)
